# orch-create-specification

## Scope

Create AI-ready implementation specifications under orchestration spec roots.

## Role Context

Before directive-specific work, call `wb-select-role-context` to resolve the compact role_context for the current task, lifecycle stage, and perspective. Work under the selected stable role context; do not invent an ad hoc role.

## Workflow Reference

Use `references/assets/orchestration/workflow.md` as the shared workflow authority.

## Directive Reference

Load `references/directives/orchestration/create-specification.md` for directive-specific behavior.

## Runtime Rules

- `orch-directive-selection`: `rules/orchestration/orch-directive-selection.md`
- `orch-orchestration-boundary`: `rules/orchestration/orch-orchestration-boundary.md`
- `orch-knowledge-gateway`: `rules/orchestration/orch-knowledge-gateway.md`
- `orch-open-questions`: `rules/orchestration/orch-open-questions.md`
- `orch-artifact-authoring`: `rules/orchestration/orch-artifact-authoring.md`
- `orch-review-completion`: `rules/orchestration/orch-review-completion.md`

## Scripts

Use `scripts/orch.py` when deterministic helper behavior is needed.

## Additional References

- `references/assets/orchestration/contract/`

## Boundary

Write generated orchestration artifacts only under .work-bundle/orchestration; do not write durable knowledge.
