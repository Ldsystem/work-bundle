# orch-create-document

## Scope

Create reader-facing orchestration documents from accepted context.

## Workflow Reference

Use `references/assets/orchestration/workflow.md` as the shared workflow authority.

## Directive Reference

Load `references/directives/orchestration/create-document.md` for directive-specific behavior.

## Runtime Rules

- `orch-orchestration-boundary`: `rules/orchestration/orch-orchestration-boundary.md`
- `orch-knowledge-gateway`: `rules/orchestration/orch-knowledge-gateway.md`
- `orch-artifact-authoring`: `rules/orchestration/orch-artifact-authoring.md`

## Rule Loading (mandatory)

Before directive-specific work, read **every** rule listed in **Runtime Rules** from disk in full.

- **Must** load all cited rule files before substantive orchestration work.
- **Must** treat loaded rule Must, Must Not, Validation, and On Violation sections as binding for this skill session.
- **Must Not** rely on conversation memory, prior runs, or directive summaries as substitutes for cited rules.
- **Must** stop and reload rules when returning to an in-progress orchestration task after context compaction or handoff.

If a cited rule path is missing or unreadable, stop and report a rule-load blocker; do not proceed.

## Scripts

Use `scripts/orch.py` when deterministic helper behavior is needed.

## Additional References

- `references/assets/orchestration/contract/`

## Boundary

Platform write boundary and durable-knowledge prohibition: follow `orch-orchestration-boundary` (`rules/orchestration/orch-orchestration-boundary.md`).

> **Deprecation:** The role-context subsystem is deprecated; see spec §0.9 in `spec-process-orch-skill-rule-boundary-optimization-20260611`. Do not invoke it from orch skills.
